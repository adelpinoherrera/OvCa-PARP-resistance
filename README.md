# OvCa-PARP-resistance
Rstudio code:
  OVCA3-scRNAseq-analysis (1).R contains the initial preprocessing of the scRNAseq samples (Naive and persistent combined). Preprocessing included quality control (scale, normalization, and finding variable features) as well as clustering 
  OVCA3-metabolic-pathway-analysis (1).R contains scoring accross 42 different metabolic pathways relevant in ovarian cancer 

Python code: 
  OvarianSetDeepVelo (1).ipynb contains the analysis of RNA velocities across the OVCA3 dataset (naive and persistent populations combined) 

Julia code:
  Glutamine_paper_2ndtry-Copy1.ipynb contains the parametarization of a logistic growth ODE model for each individual cell type and media conditions 
  Co-culture_simulations.ipynb contains the parametarization of a naive and persistent co-culture model at different initial persistent percentages using the growth parameters previously collected and the data from cell culture at different media conditions
